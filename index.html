There are quantitative type such as “Count”, and also “ordinal” type field like “year”. There are total 69216 rows and 7 columns.</p><h2 id="visualization">visualization</h2><select options="Ethnicity,Race,Age Group"><option selected="" value="Ethnicity">Ethnicity</option><option value="Race">Race</option><option value="Age Group">Age Group</option></select><div></div><p>This panel is easy to use, there is only one drop list to choose the variable. And you can choose one from it, after you choose the variable, the plot will update and it will plot the total death against the variable. For example, if you choose ‘Ethnicity’ as the variable, then it will plot bar chart about the total death against differnt Ethnicity.</p><p>It is very obvious that, the central interactive visualization is ploting the total death number against differnt groups of people. Besides different groups of people, there is another column “year”, so we can also plot the total death number against the time, see is there any increasing or decreasing trend on the death number.</p><div></div><p>Besides the trend of the death number, we can also plot the death number against gender. Before i plot the graph, actually we can make some guess on the result, one of the guess can be the death number ratio between male and female is equal to the gender ratio of total population. And let’s see the result. In order to make it clear, i use two differnt plot, first one is pie chart, since pie chart can show the ratio clearly, it can show the comparison clearly. And second one is bar chart, since bar chart can show the total number.</p><div></div><div></div><p><span>And here is the result, from the number we get in bar chart, we can calculate that the ratio is about 51:49. And the census result from <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/IL">https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/IL</a> (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Illinois, n.d.), shows that the female percentage is 50.9%, that is a perfect match to our visualization. And we can conclude that the death number gender ratio is proportional to total population gender ratio.</span></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this report, i mainly use bar chart to visualize the data, because we are focus on the count for differnt groups, so bar chart is the best plot in this case. And this visualization tells the differnt death number for differnt groups of people, and it is helpful for some further death cause analysis. The part i like is that this visualization is simple and clear, bar chart can clearly tell the differnce on each groups, users can get the information easily. However, on another hand, i think this dataset is too simple, it carrys too little information, it is almost all the information i can extract from this dataset, so maybe i need some other related contextual dataset to support this visualization.</p><h1 id="reference">Reference</h1><p><span>IDPH Death Data 2010-2017 - Death Data 2010-2017.csv - data.illinois.gov.
